# AR/VR Project – Offshore Wind Farm Visualization 🌊⚡

An **Augmented Reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR)** project focused on visualizing an **Offshore Wind Farm** using immersive 3D environments.

This project demonstrates how AR/VR technologies can be used for **renewable energy visualization, education, and interactive exploration**.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The AR/VR Offshore Wind Farm Project allows users to explore wind turbine layouts and components in a virtual environment or place them in real-world space using AR.

The goal of this project is to provide an intuitive and interactive way to understand offshore wind energy infrastructure through immersive technologies.
